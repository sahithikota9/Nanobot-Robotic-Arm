# Nanobot – Arduino Based Robotic Arm

## Project Overview
Nanobot is an Arduino and ESP32-based robotic arm designed for precise pick-and-place operations. 
It can be controlled wirelessly using Bluetooth commands.

## Features
- ESP32-based Bluetooth control
- Smooth servo motor movement
- Pick and drop objects weighing up to 100–200 grams
- Reset and default positioning system

## Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32
- Servo Motors
- Bluetooth Communication
- 3D Printed Structure

## How It Works
The ESP32 receives Bluetooth commands and controls three servo motors:
- Base rotation
- Elbow movement
- Claw operation

## Team Contribution
Worked on coding, building, and documentation of the robotic arm.

## Academic Use
This project was developed as a student robotics project to gain hands-on experience in 
embedded systems, automation, and hardware integration.
